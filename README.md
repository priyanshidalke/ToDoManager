About the project :
It is a web based application. I have created the front end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and ReactJS. And for the backend I have used Node.js. The database which I have used is MongoDB. I have stored the information about catagories, users and their to-dos in the database.

Prerequisites :
You should have node and MongoDB installed. For the ReactJS part, I have created jsx file which will be converted to js file. For that you should have babel installed. 

Execution :
For running the application, first start MongoDB server. Then run the server.js file. Now go to the browser and type in address bar:
http://localhost:5050/login.html
